# SwiftUnwrap
Swift Unwrap. This is the swift playground I use to learn basic concepts of swift. This Playground consists of all the basics of swift language like almost all the basic topics.  Every topic is covered with  definition, syntax and an example. Every example demonstrates how that particular concept works which gives a clear understanding. I update this repo very often because every topic I learn I'll commit here.
